		<h1>The Story</h1>
		<div id = "textbox">
			<p>On a dark and stormy night, Wilson appears to be getting nowhere in a chemistry experiment until he is startled by his radio speaking to him. It reveals that it has noticed his trouble and has "secret knowledge" for him. When he eagerly agrees, a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head with this information. Using white rats, a typewriter, and his own blood, among other tools and materials, Wilson creates a giant machine. The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine's switch. He hesitates, but at the radio's insistence, he does it; the machine rattles violently and a pair of ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an apparition of Maxwell cackles.</p>

			<p>As the player wakes up each morning during the Adventure mode, Maxwell appears over them and comments. At first he seems impressed at the player's hardiness; he then becomes irritated and urges the player to turn back. He offers the player a truce but then becomes completely enraged.</p>

			<p>At the end of Adventure, the player reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall belonging to Maxwell on it. The player finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him, but finds a keyhole, as well as a key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as soon as he stands up. The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare them in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player will take on a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using new-found powers given by the throne, but will nonetheless be trapped forever.</p>
